# PROJECT_3_CORNERGROCER

This project required me to create a program that analyzes text records generated throughout the day for Corner Grocer.
I think I did well on creating code for the class with public and private members, as well as defining the various functions needed. I also followed industry best practices by including appropriate and relevant in line comments. I currently don't see where I could enhance my code, but that is also because I'm still learning what works for me when writing programs.

The piece I found most challenging to do was getting visual studio to read the input file for the items. I had quite a few issues with this, but I was able to find a video on you tube that guided me through the proper steps to complete this part.

The skill that stood out to me the most in this project was using the  "SENTINEL" function. This function will be especially valuable in the future when I'm creating programs with larger amounts of data such at this one.

I made this program readable and maintainable by using proper spacing, syntax ,functions and appropriate in line comments. The code is also easily maintainable because of it's changebility, testability, and reliability.
